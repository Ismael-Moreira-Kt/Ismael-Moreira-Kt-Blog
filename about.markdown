## Who I am?
I'm Ismael, a software developer with a keen interest in the deeper, often neglected theoretical aspects of our field. While my expertise primarily lies in Java development, my true passion lies in exploring the foundational theories that shape our industry. My journey in software development has led me to create this blog as a space to share daily insights and discoveries. I aim to delve into topics that many overlook, striving to enrich the theoretical framework that underpins our work.

## What is this Site?
Welcome to my blog, where I delve into the depths of software theory and development. This site is dedicated to discussing the intricate theoretical aspects that influence our daily work as developers. Here, I aim to bridge the gap between practical application and theoretical knowledge, offering insights into topics such as low-level programming, language theory, and more. Through articles and discussions, I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of software development and inspire fellow developers to explore beyond the surface of our field.
